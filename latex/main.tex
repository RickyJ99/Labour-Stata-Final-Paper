\begin{abstract}

This study aims to estimate age-wage profiles and human capital depreciation rates for different education levels in Italy, using a dynamic panel dataset covering the period from 1980 to 2019. Specifically, we estimate depreciation rates for primary, secondary, and tertiary education levels, providing a comprehensive understanding of differences in human capital depreciation. We also investigate gender differences in depreciation rates, which can have implications for long-term economic growth and development. Our findings indicate that achieving a secondary education level compared to lower secondary leads to a 1\% increase in the return of human capital and a 0.5\% decrease in time spent working. Additionally, the study suggests that the gender gap in wage-age and hours-age profiles is wider for higher-educated women, with a return on human capital of 2.2\% per year lower compared to men.

\section{Introduction}
The Ben-Porath model has been widely used in economic research to explain differences in wage-age profiles resulting
from variations in human capital. Human capital encompasses the knowledge, skills, and abilities individuals gain
through education and training, enabling them to participate in the labor market and contribute to the economy. While
human capital is subject to depreciation over time, individuals can invest in their human capital to improve it. The
difference equation that describes human capital includes a depreciation rate, a cohort-specific productivity parameter,
a curvature parameter, and age t.
\newline
Numerous studies have employed the model\citet{ben1967production} to analyze cross-regional differences in wage profiles
\citet{baker1997human} and the evolution of wage inequality as in \citet{joshi2021gender} and in\citet{erosa2012human}.
However, there is still a need to explore how human capital evolves over time for individuals with different levels of
schooling, with a focus on potential differences in the wage profiles of women. Understanding the evolution of human
capital is crucial to identifying potential constraints to long-term economic growth as shown in \cite{mincer1981human},
as a population with higher depreciation rates and poor human capital can limit potential growth. Moreover, identified
different returns on human capital, allows to better understand the incentive to invest in education.
\newline
This paper aims to estimate the age-wage profiles and depreciation rates for different education levels while minimizing
assumptions, following Hendriks\cite{hendricks2013ben}' method $\log{y}$. Additionally, we will examine the impact of
gender discrimination on the long-term human capital of women, which can generate different returns to education. The
findings of this study will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of human capital accumulation and depreciation
in Italy. This research also informs policy interventions aimed at promoting economic growth and development by
highlighting potential constraints to long-term growth and the importance of reducing discrimination in the labor
market.
\newline
Ultimately, this research contributes to the broader literature on the role of education and human capital in economic
growth and development, as well as the importance of promoting gender equality in the labor market.

\section{Empirical part}
The empirical questions that we are going to answer are the followings:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the return in remuneration of human capital for different levels of education?
    \item Is there a difference in the remuneration of human capital between male and female?
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{The model predictions}
The Ben-Porath model suggests that the depreciation rate of human capital is a linear function of time and depends on
the level of human capital. This is because individuals with higher human capital face a higher depreciation rate,
similar to the relationship between capital and growth in the growth theory. As such, we can expect that individuals
with lower education levels, and therefore lower levels of human capital, will experience a lower depreciation rate
compared to those with higher levels of education. \newline
In terms of the wage-age profile, individuals with lower education levels will typically invest less in human capital
and reach their maximum wage sooner and at a lower level compared to those with higher education levels. This is due to
the fact that individuals with higher levels of education are more likely to have  skills and knowledge, which can lead
to higher wages and greater career opportunities later in the careers.
\subsection{Specification}
We use regression on the Conditional Expectation Function (CEF) as a method to estimate the relationship between the
dependent variable:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\log{wage}_{i,t}$
    \item $\log{hours}_{i,t}$
\end{itemize}
( and  where $i$ is the individual $i$ at the age $t$) and independent variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $age, age^2$: the age and the age squared of the individual $i$ of the year $y$
    \item $i.cohort$ is the list of dummies of the cohorts
    \item $i.years$ is the list of dummies for the years class (class size $=5$).
\end{itemize}
while controlling for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $educ={3,5}$ Educational level: $3:$ middle school, $5:$ High school level
    \item $female={0,1}$  Sex $(=1 if female)$
\end{itemize}

There are four specification that we are going to use 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item   \label{spec1}    \(\log{wage}_{i,y}=   \beta_1 age_{i}+ \beta_2 age_{i}^2+i.cohort+i.years |educ={3,5}\)
    \item   \label{spec2}    \(\log{wage}_{i,y}=   \beta_1 age_{i}+ \beta_2 age_{i}^2+i.cohort+i.years |educ={3,5},sex=
    {0 (male), 1 (female)}\)
    \item  \label{spec3}    \(\log{hours}_{i,y}=  \beta_1 age_{i}+ \beta_2 age_{i}^2+i.cohort+i.years |educ={3,5}\)
    \item   \label{spec4}    \(\log{hours}_{i,y}= \beta_1 age_{i}+ \beta_2 age_{i}^2+i.cohort+i.years |educ={3,5},sex=
    {0 (male), 1 (female)}\)
\end{enumerate}
We adopt the specifications given by \citet{hendricks2013ben} denoted as \ref{spec1} and \ref{spec2}. However, we do not
include a gender fixed effect in the regression analysis, as we aim to allow gender to affect the estimates of $\eta$
and $\eta^2$ in a time-varying manner. This approach is similar to that proposed by \citet{joshi2021gender}. We also
refrain from using the month of job as a proxy for experience, as it may result in collinearity issues. Moreover, since
the dataset excludes periods of unemployment, we can assume that $exp + edu \approx \eta$. The CEF method has several
limitations. First, it assumes that the age and education variables capture all the relevant dimensions of human
capital, which may not be the case. Other important factors, such as experience or on-the-job training, are not
explicitly considered in the model. Second, the method may suffer from omitted variable bias if there are unobserved
characteristics that affect both wages and education levels. Third, the CEF method assumes that the relationship between
age, education, and wages is linear, which may not hold in reality. 

\subsection{Identification strategy}
To estimate the depreciation rate of human capital for different levels of education, we need to implement an
identification strategy that allows us to separate the effects of age, education, cohort and year on wage profiles. In
this section, we describe the identification strategy we use in our study.
\newline
To begin with, we assume that the cohort effects are the same for all agents in the same 5-year cohort. This assumption
is motivated by the fact that individuals who are born in the same 5-year period tend to share similar social, economic,
and political experiences during their formative years. For example, individuals who were born during a period of
economic growth may have had more educational opportunities compared to those who were born during a period of economic
recession. By assuming that cohort effects are constant across individuals in the same 5-year cohort, we can control for
unobserved heterogeneity that is specific to a particular cohort.In order to ensure consistent estimates, it is
necessary to impose these restrictions. Without them, there would be a problem of collinearity.
\newline
Secondly, we assume that the initial human endowment is the same within the same cohort. This assumption implies that
individuals who are born in the same 5-year cohort have similar levels of human capital at the beginning of their
careers, before they have invested in additional education or training. By assuming that the initial human endowment is
constant within the same cohort, we can control for unobserved heterogeneity that is specific to a particular birth
cohort.
\newline
The same assumption applies to year effects, meaning that individuals within the same cohort experience the same effects
on wages over a period of 5 years.
\newline
The restrictions imposed on the model are based on some naive assumptions about the behavior of individuals with respect
to their education and human capital. For instance, it is reasonable to assume that individuals who are born in the same
5-year cohort would have similar opportunities for education and training. Similarly, individuals who start with the
same initial human capital endowment within the same cohort are likely to face similar labor market opportunities over
time.\newline
While these assumptions may not hold perfectly in reality, they provide a useful framework for identifying the key
factors that drive the age-wage profile and depreciation rates of human capital for different levels of education in
Italy. By controlling for cohort and year effects in our analysis, we can isolate the effect of age and education on
wages and estimate the rate of human capital depreciation for different groups of individuals.
\newline
To estimate the depreciation rate of human capital for different levels of education, we use a longitudinal panel data.
Specifically, to estimate the age-wage profiles and the depreciation rates of human capital for different levels of
education in Italy, we employ an OLS approach. We run two separate OLS regressions for individuals with a
lower-secondary education and those with a high school level education, respectively. The dependent variable is the
natural logarithm of the wage, and the key independent variables are age and age squared. We control for cohort effects
and year effects by including birth year dummies and calendar year dummies, respectively. Additionally, the wage
variable is corrected for inflation using the consumer price index.
\newline
Moreover, to examine gender differences in the evolution of human capital, we perform four separate regressions
conditioned on gender and two levels of education, as specified in\ref{spec2}. To capture the potential variation in
gender effects over time, we employ the regression on the conditional expectation function. Additionally, we use the
same method $\log{y}$ to estimate the gender gap in the hours-age profile.
\newline
 Applied Overall, our identification strategy allows us to separate the effects of age, education, and cohort on wage
 profiles and estimate the depreciation rate of human capital for different levels of education. By using a longitudinal
 panel data approach and controlling for individual-specific unobserved heterogeneity and time-varying factors, we can
 obtain more accurate estimates of the depreciation rate of human capital, which is a crucial variable that affects
 overall economic growth and development.
\section{Data and descriptive statistics}
\subsection{Data}
The data used in this study are obtained from the Family Income Survey of the Bank of Italy, which spans a period from
1980 to 2020 with $\sim100.000 obs$. The sample comprises employees\footnote{We drop the observation for self-employed
since including would rise an issue of undereporting} both men and women born between 1940 and 2020. To expand our
sample size, we have divided the population into 56 birth cohorts, where each cohort covers five consecutive birth
years. We have also applied the same division for years, where each group includes five years. The following
table\ref{Tab:desc-cohort} tabulate the distribution on observations for cohort. The cohort with the highest density of
observations is cohort 10, whereas the younger and older cohorts have relatively few observations. The objective of the
study is to estimate wage-age profiles, which required the use of employee income reports merged with family and
individual statistics. To calculate $\\log{wage}_{i,t}$, we employed a series of transformations. Firstly, we summed the
monetary and non-monetary components of income. Secondly, we deflated the income figures using the Consumer Price Index
(CPI). Thirdly, we divided the income figures by the monthly hours worked and multiplied by 13 months to obtain the
annual income. Fourthly, we took the logarithm of the annual income figure. Finally, we merged the resulting dataset
with individual-level data.
\newline
The process of computing $\\log{wage}_{i,t}$ was essential for the analysis, as it allowed us to measure the variation
in wages over time, which is critical for estimating wage-age profiles. By merging different datasets, we were able to
obtain a more comprehensive picture of the factors influencing wage dynamics in Italy. We follow these steps to get
$\\log{wage}_{i,t}$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sum monetary and non monetary components 
    \item Deflating for CPI
    \item dividing for the monthly hours and multiply for 13 month
    \item take $\log{s}$
    \item merging with other dataset with individual data
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Descriptive statistics}

The tables presented in this paper (see Tables\ref{Tab:desc-1a} and\ref{Tab:desc-1b}) provide a detailed overview of the
descriptive statistics for two key variables: the logarithm of wages and annual working hours. The tables show the mean,
standard error, and t-test for the difference in mean for each variable across four different groups based on education
level and gender. Specifically, the groups are defined by individuals with a low level of secondary school education,
those with a secondary school education level, and these subgroups further differentiated by sex.
\newline
The statistical results from the tables indicate that individuals with a secondary school education level tend to earn
higher wages than those with a lower level of education. Moreover, the wage gap between genders is more pronounced among
those with a secondary school education level. In other words, women tend to earn less than men across all education
levels, and the difference is wider for those with a higher level of education.
\newline
In terms of annual working hours, the statistics indicate that individuals with a lower level of education tend to work
more hours than those with a higher level of education. However, this trend is reversed when looking at gender
differences. Women tend to work fewer hours compared to men across all education levels as show in \citet{goldin}. Interestingly, this gender gap
in working hours narrows as the level of education increases. It is important to note that the data used in the analysis
covers a period from 1980 to 2020, during which the participation of women in the labor market has increased
significantly. Thus, the true difference in working hours between genders may be even greater for individuals with the
same characteristics.\newline
In order to better understand the relationship between education level and economic outcomes, it is often useful to
examine a specific cohort in a given year. This approach is particularly relevant when working with panel data, as it
allows for a more detailed analysis of trends and patterns over time. By focusing on a single cohort, we can examine the
distribution of key economic variables such as wage, income, and annual hours worked, conditional on different levels of
education. This type of analysis can reveal important insights into the labour market for specific subgroups, and help
to identify disparities and trends that may not be apparent when analyzing data at the aggregate level.
\newline
The table\ref{tab:desc-cohort10} presented in this study reports on the wage and working hours of a specific cohort in the
year 2008. The descriptive statistics show that wages are positively correlated with education level, which is
consistent with the trend observed in the previous  tables\ref{Tab:desc-1a}\ref{Tab:desc-1b}. Additionally, the
statistics reveal a decreasing trend in working hours as the level of education increases. This finding suggests that
individuals with higher levels of education are able to earn higher wages while working fewer hours, potentially due to
their possession of skills or abilities that increase their productivity as according to the human capital model. It is
important to note that this specific cohort has a mean age of 50, which is a significant age for the human capital
model. This is because at this age, individuals have typically spent their time endowments in work without investing in
human capital. Therefore, these summary statistics must be interpreted in light of the fact that this cohort represents
middle-aged workers who have already invested significant time and resources into their careers.\newline
In conclusion, the descriptive statistics presented in this paper provide valuable insights into the labor market
outcomes of individuals with different levels of education. Our analysis revealed that, on average, individuals with
higher levels of education tend to earn higher wages and work fewer hours than those with lower levels of education. We
also found that there are significant gender disparities in labor market outcomes, with women generally earning less and
working fewer hours than men.
\section{Empirical results}
The empirical results section of this paper is dedicated to presenting our comprehensive analysis of the relationship
between human capital evolution and education and gender characteristics. In this section, we aim to shed light on
several key questions that are relevant to understanding the dynamics of the labor market. Specifically, we explore the
impact of attaining a secondary education level on the wage age profile, and whether gender differences exist in the
wage age profile for individuals with the same level of education. Additionally, we investigate the hours-age profiles
for individuals with lower levels of education and those with higher levels, assessing how investing in human capital
affects the hour-age profile. Lastly, we examine the gender gap in these profiles to identify potential disparities and
trends that may exist. Through this analysis, we hope to provide valuable insights into the labor market for specific
subgroups and contribute to the broader understanding of human capital evolution.
\subsection{The estimation of wage age profile}
According to the human capital theory, the wage-age profile reflects the relationship between an individual's age and
their wages, which is influenced by their investment in human capital over time. To explore this relationship, we use
regression analysis with specification\ref{spec1} and present the results in Table\ref{Tab:reg1}. The key parameters
include $\beta_{age2}$, which indicates the decline in wages over time and reflects depreciation, and $\beta_{age}$,
which represents the return on investment in human capital over time. All the coefficients are statistically
significant, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of the labor market and the role of human capital investments
in shaping the wage-age profile.
\newline
If we focus on individuals with lower education\ref{reg1_w_leduc}, the results indicate that an increase of one year in
age leads to an increase of $\approx 11\%$ in wages. On the other hand, for individuals with higher education
\ref{reg1_w_heduc}, an increase of one year in age leads to an increase of approximately $\approx 12.6\%$ in wages. These findings
are consistent with the human capital theory, which suggests that having a secondary level education instead of a lower
secondary education leads to higher returns, while the depreciation rate remains the same for both groups. However, the low value
of $R_{overall}^2 \approx 11\%$ suggests that the regression has very limited predictive power, possibly due to the restrictions imposed to
isolate the cohort and year fixed effects.
\newline
To visually inspects the results we show the predicted wages by cohorts.
\newline
In this section, we present a graph (see Figure\ref{fig:pred_reg}) that visually depicts the relationship between
education levels and wages across different age cohorts. The results are intriguing, as they suggest that there is a
notable difference in the wage gap between older and younger cohorts. The graph shows that the wage gap is larger for
the older cohort, while the younger cohorts have a narrower difference. This finding is consistent with the notion that
higher educated individuals tend to spend part of their time endowment continuing to invest in their human capital
during the early stages of their careers, while the lower educated tend to have more experience as they started working
early, thus accumulating specialized skills. It is worth noting that this observation may indicate that specialized
skills have a higher depreciation rate and a lower return on the long term. It would be interesting to extend the model
to include two types of human capital assets: one with a higher short-term return and higher depreciation, and another
that is more costly but has lower depreciation, and then let the agent choose the optimal level of the two assets
following the idea of \citet{Kruger}.
\newline
The findings of our study support the theory that higher levels of human capital lead to higher wages. Specifically, the
graph\ref{fig:pred_reg} demonstrates that individuals with higher levels of education consistently earn higher wages compared to those
with lower education levels across all age cohorts. This observation highlights the importance of investing in human
capital, particularly at the early stages of one's career, to enhance earning potential in the long term.
\newline
Furthermore, the graph\ref{fig:pred_reg} also shows that the wage gap between education levels widens over time. This suggests that
younger cohorts have a smaller wage gap because the lower-educated individuals are more experienced in the labor market,
while the higher-educated individuals are just starting out. However, as time goes by, the market starts to remunerate
better those individuals who have invested in higher human capital.
\newline
Building upon these findings, we extend our analysis to include the effects of gender on wages by conducting a
regression analysis similar to the one before but with gender as a conditioning variable. This will allow us to examine
the gender wage gap across different education levels and age cohorts, providing important insights into the dynamics of
the labor market and the role of gender in wage determination.
\newline
The results presented in Table\ref{Tab:reg2} indicate that there is clear evidence of a lower return on education for
females, with $\beta_{age,female}$ (as shown in columns\ref{Reg:2_H_F}\ref{Reg:2_L_F}) being lower than
$\beta_{age,male}$ (shown in columns\ref{Reg:2_H_M}\ref{Reg:2_L_M}). This effect is more pronounced for individuals
with higher levels of education, as the marginal gap with respect to age is wider, with $\Delta_{secondary} \approx
2.2\%$ per year for those with secondary education, and $\Delta_{lower\ secondary} \approx 1.4\%$ per year for those
with lower secondary education. This result is consistent with previous research \citet{erosa2012human} and implies a
lower return on investment in human capital for females.
Interestingly, there is no statistically significant difference in the depreciation of capital over time between males and females, as $\beta_{eta^2}|female,sex = \beta_{eta^2, female}|female,sex$ and is approximately $0.83\%$.
\newline
The gender wage gap can be decomposed into two factors that widen it over time: the increase in wages as a result of acquiring working experience, represented by $\beta_{Age}$, and the decrease in wages, represented by $\beta_{Age^2}$.
\newline
These findings emphasize the importance of considering gender as a conditioning variable in wage regression analysis, as
it provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the labor market and the role of human capital investments in shaping
the wage-age profile. Moreover, the results suggest that women have lower remuneration for their human capital, which
partially explains the wide difference in wages shown in Table\ref{Tab:desc-1a}.
To better understand the difference in the evolution of wage-age profiles for women and men, we plot a chart of the
predicted $\log(wage)$ comparing individuals with the same level of education but with different genders.
\newline
The chart\ref{fig:w_gend_l} illustrates that male wage-age profiles conditional on different level of education across
all cohorts, while the chart\ref{fig:w_gend_l_cohort8} only for cohort 6. Now we take a look at the same results for
secondary school and lower secondary. 
\newline
The chart\ref{fig:w_gend_l_cohort8} show an higher gender gap for low educated that does not fade out as the time
passes. It is important to remember that the prediction on wage is base only on th observables, thus  women that drop
out the job and stay home are not take into account, thus the gap that we observe is only for the women that stays in
the market. Moreover the wage gap is less accentuated for women with higher education, but this can be justified by the
fact that female that choose to remain in the market are the ones without childbearing obligations or the ones that are
paid more.\footnote{Studying the decision of drop out of women can be useful to understand the reservation wage and
thus to instrument the observability of wage; moreover the drop rates is so high that estimating the effect of having
child for female increases the wage by 8\% this is clearly due to the fact the the participation rates after first child
shrink dramatically leaving only female with higher wages and the once without child } Futhermore, the mean age in
cohort 6 is 48, thus the graph\ref{fig:w_gend_l_cohort8} approximates the gender gaps  only in the neighborhood  of
this age. Regardless the strong bias due to endogeneity about the extensive margin decision, the wage age profiles for
females remains lower than man, meaning female has a lower return on year of education compare to man.
\newline
Overall the estimate return in education are consistent with the human capital theory even here the comparison was by
individual with lower secondary and secondary education level, it would had been better the comparison with individuals
with a bachelor. However it is not possible since the are only few observations $\approx 600$ to get significant
estimate of the key dependent variables. Regarding the gender differences it is clear that there is a lower return on
human capital for female compare to man, notwithstanding this gap is strongly underestimated for the motivations written
above.

\subsection{The estimation of hour age profile}
Working hours is a fundamental variable in the human capital model, as it is the outcome of an optimization process
whereby individuals choose how much of their time endowment to allocate towards increasing their human capital, and how
much to devote to working. In this sense, working hours can be seen as a proxy for investment in human capital, as
individuals who invest more time in developing their skills and knowledge may have fewer hours available for paid
work.\newline
First, we will look at the difference in the hours-age profiles for individuals with different levels of education. Second, we will look at the difference in the hours-age profile as before but conditioning on gender. In the following Table \ref{Tab:reg3}, we estimate with OLS the second specification \ref{spec2} for lower secondary and secondary education level. In column (1) \ref{Reg:3_h}, the results of the regression for the group that has achieved a secondary school education level are reported, while in column (2) \ref{Reg:3_l}, the results of the regression on the individuals that achieved only lower secondary school are reported.
\newline
Our analysis shows that individuals with lower levels of education tend to start working earlier in life compared to
those with higher education. Indeed, the $\beta_{age}$ is positive for those who spend more time in school, while
negative\footnote{both statistically significant, even if for the higher educated only at 10\%, while for the low
educated at 1\%}, meaning that for the higher educated, the time endowment spent in working is increasing over time with
a rate of $0.7\%$ per year.  The observation that the time spent working decreases over time with a rate of $-0.5\%$ per
year for lower-educated individuals is in line with the idea that higher-educated individuals tend to increase their
working hours over time as they invest in their human capital early in their careers, and gradually reduce their working
hours as they gain experience. This pattern is consistent with the human capital model, which predicts that individuals
with lower levels of education tend to start working earlier in life to maximize their immediate earnings, while those
with higher education may delay their entry into the labor market as they invest in their human capital.
\newline
To visually inspect these results, we plot the predicted values for working hours by education level, separating each
cohort (figure.\ref{fig:hours}). This allows us to see the trends in working hours across different levels of education
for each cohort, providing further insight into the relationship between human capital and working hours
\newline
In the presented graph, the red line represents the hours-age profiles for individuals with lower secondary school
education. These individuals tend to start spending their time endowment working earlier compared to those with
secondary education. Additionally, individuals with lower education have a higher hours-age profile, which decreases
over time. The peak of the red group's hours-age profile is reached in the early years of their working career, and then
the curve slightly decreases over time. In contrast, for those with higher education, the peak is reached between 40 and
50 years old, and then starts to decrease. It is important to emphasize that individuals with higher education spend
less time working for all years, and this trend is observed in all cohorts.
\newline
To look a gender differences in the hours-age profile we run the same regression specification as above\ref{spec4}, but
conditioning on gender. The results are showed in the table\ref{Reg:4_h_f}. As in the results without conditioning on gender,
the slope of the hours-age profile is negative for individual with higher education level. Notwithstanding, for women
the slope are flatter across all level of education, indeed $\Delta_{female-male}\beta_{age} \approx 0.1\%$ per year,
meaning that women increases more mildly the time spent working\footnote{considering that women that drops the job after
having children are unobservable, this gap can be even higher}.
Moreover, female with low education has a steeper negative hours-age profiles $\beta_{eta}|female \approx -1.7\%$ per
year and $\Delta_{female-male}\beta_{age} \approx 1.2\%$ per year, signaling that low educated women tends
to decrease at faster rate the participation in the labour market in the intensive margin compare to the higher ones,
moreover the gender gap is wider compare to the more educated.  
\newline
To visually compare the predicted working hours by cohort for males (higher educate in orange, lower educated in red)
and females (lower educated in blue and higher educated in green) at different levels
of education, we plotted the the predicted values of the regression of\ref{reg4}in Figure\ref{fig:h_l_cohorts}, while in
the Figure\ref{fig:h_l_coh8} we plot the predicted value for the middle-age cohort 7. 
\newline
The figure\ref{fig:h_l_cohorts} illustrates that, across all cohorts, men have higher hours-age profiles than women,
indicating that women have lower participation in the intensive margin compared to men, regardless of educational
attainment. Additionally, for women with lower education, the hours-age profile declines rapidly in the initial stages
of their working lives, particularly between ages 20 and 30. Consequently, the gap between low-educated females and
males widens considerably during this period, reaching its peak at around ages 40. Conversely, for women who stay
in school longer, there is an increase in participation (intensive margin) during the early stages of their careers,
between ages 20 and 30, when the hours-age profile reaches its maximum. Subsequently, the participation rate either
declines or remains stable. However, it is worth noting that the decrease in hourly worked for women is significantly
underestimated since the probability of dropping out of the labor force after having the first child is around 30\% for
individuals with lower and secondary school education, as demonstrated by \citet{Bratti2005}, which implies that a large
proportion of female labor force participation is unobservable.
\newline
Additionally, the gender gap in the hourly-age profile reaches its peak at around age 50 for those with higher
education, which is in line with the idea that women who stay in school longer tend to have their first child later,
thereby delaying their childbearing years to later stages of their working lives. Subsequently, after age 50, the gap
begins to decrease slightly but remains significant until the end of their working careers. Interestingly, the gender
gap in the hourly-age profile is wider for those who spent more time in schooling, as observed in the younger cohort.
 One possible explanation can be that Women who pursue higher levels of education may face additional pressure to conform to
traditional gender roles, such as being a caregiver for children and elderly family members, which can lead to a
reduction in their labor force participation or hours worked. This can be particularly true during the early stages of
their careers when they are starting families or establishing themselves in their chosen fields. On the other hand, men
who pursue higher education may face fewer societal expectations to prioritize caregiving responsibilities over their
careers. Thus, they may be able to invest more time and effort into their careers, leading to higher hours worked and a
wider gender gap in the hourly-age profile.
\newline
The hours-age
profiles for lower educated women were consistently lower than for men across all cohorts, indicating that this gender
gap persists over time. However, for higher educated individuals, the gender differences were not apparent (as shown in
Figure\ref{fig:h_l_cohorts}).
\newline
Overall, our empirical findings are in line with the human capital theory, as we found a positive and statistically
significant effect of education on human capital remuneration, and a concave wage-age profile as predicted by the model
with depreciation $\Delta > 0$. Additionally, the hours-age profile supports the human capital model's predictions, with
higher educated individuals having an increasing hours-age profile, and lower educated individuals having a decreasing
one. Furthermore, our analysis of the gender gap in the hours-age profile shows that women tend to have a lower participation in
the intensive margin compared to men, regardless of their level of educational attainment. The gap is wider for lower educated
women, and it decreases slightly for higher educated women after the age of 50, which is consistent with the fact that
they tend to have their first child later and shift childbearing years later in their working life. It is also
interesting to note that the gender gap in the hourly-age profile at the beginning of the career is wider for those who
spent more time in schooling, as seen in the younger cohort. These findings provide insights into the complex interplay
between education, gender, and labor market outcomes.
\section{Conclusions}
In conclusion, this paper has provided an analysis of the gender wage gap in a European country, focusing on the role of
education and human capital. The empirical findings are consistent with the human capital theory, as we observe a
positive statistically significant effect of education on the remuneration of human capital and a concave shape of the
wage-age profile, in line with the model with $\Delta > 0$.
\newline
Furthermore, the analysis shows that the gender wage gap widens over time, mainly due to differences in the remuneration
of human capital between men and women. Women have a lower remuneration of human capital, even for the same level of
education, which can be partly explained by differences in working hours, as women tend to invest less time in
developing their skills and knowledge.
\newline
The results also indicate that individuals with lower levels of education start working earlier, with the aim of
maximizing their immediate earnings, while those with higher levels of education may take longer to start working as
they invest in their human capital. This is reflected in the hours-age profile, which decreases over time for those with
lower education, while it increases for those with higher education.
\newline
However, it is important to note that the analysis has certain limitations. Firstly, the restriction imposed on cohort
fixed effects and years fixed effects, which may not capture all the heterogeneity in the data. Secondly, the analysis
only focuses on a single country, and the results may not be generalizable to other contexts. Finally, the study does
not account for the potential impact of discrimination and other factors that may contribute to the gender wage gap.
\newline
Overall, this study provides insights into the factors that contribute to the gender wage gap and highlights the
importance of education and human capital in determining individuals' earnings. Further research is needed to explore
the role of other factors, such as discrimination and family responsibilities, and to investigate the effectiveness of
policies aimed at reducing the gender wage gap.
